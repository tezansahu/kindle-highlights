ideally, companies should report tax rate anywhere between 30%-35% (until 2019). If that is not the case, then you need to dig deeper. Figure out the average tax rate for 5-6 years and verify whether it matches the prevalent corporate tax rate.

Without any tax incentive, if a company keeps reporting lower tax rate over a few years period, then it raises question on corporate governance and management quality. 4.5 Management Evaluation #3 Return on Equity (ROE) Return on Equity is the single most powerful ratio. It can even throw light on the management quality and whether companies are manipulating their accounts or not. High and consistent ROE is an indication that the management is utilising the capital effectively. Manipulating account means you have to either overstate the assets portion of the balance sheet or inflate the expense side of the income statement. The beauty is any such occurrence will automatically lower the Return on Equity. Suppose you are overstating profit, so you have to inflate revenue (sales numbers) and understate expenses. Now, your fictitious profit must be stored in the “assets” portion of the balance sheet. By doing so, you are lowering Return on Equity. So, companies which are manipulating their books can’t report high ROE consistently. Always consider the last 5 year’s average ROE. The last 5 year’s average ROE of more than 20% indicates that the company is unlikely manipulating their accounts. Companies having last 5 year’s average ROE of more than 20% not only offers immense upside potential but also protects the downside risk. Considering other financial parameters remain same, stocks with

Considering business prospects remain similar, we can summarise our valuation method as follows- ➢     If current valuation (P.E and P.B ratio) is less than the last five years average or hovers around average and the current P.E is less than two times of the last three years average EPS growth (PEG ratio < 2), then buying opportunity can be explored. ➢     If current P.E is double the last three years average profit growth rate (PEG >2) and the current valuation is in the highest band of the previous five years average, then explore selling/profit booking opportunity. ➢     If current valuation (P.E and P.B ratio) is less than the last five years average and the current P.E is less than half of the last three years average profit growth (PEG ratio < 0.5), then it requires in-depth attention. That can be either a great investment opportunity or a “value trap”. ➢     To judge any cyclical business, you can alter the consideration period. Instead of 3 years or 5 years average value, you can consider any period based upon the circumstances.

if you have a reliable, independent equity advisor then you should stick to direct equity investment. Alternatively, if you have enough time in hand for equity research and love to spend time with stocks, then you should avoid mutual fund. It is far better to manage your money on your own (if you know what you’re doing) than to depend on a fund manager. Mutual fund is beneficial if you don’t have time and a reliable equity advisor for guidance in direct equity investment.

Contrary to what many people believe, dopamine is not a pleasure chemical. Simply because an event triggers the release of dopamine doesn’t mean it is something we like or get pleasure from. In fact, when you pay close attention, you’ll notice that as soon as you obtain the expected reward, you’ll often feel empty and unfulfilled.

To sum up, in order to implement a successful dopamine detox you should: Identify your biggest temptations and/or distractions and write them down on the sheet of paper. Then, make sure you put the sheet in a prominent position. Make unwanted behaviors harder to engage in by adding friction. Make desired behaves easier to engage in by reducing friction. Implement a simple morning routine to calm your mind and start your day with a low level of stimulation.

5. Studying Anything Learning new information isn’t helpful unless it can be recalled later. Anything that increases one’s memory power increases access to everything learned.
 —Richard Restak, MD As I’ve said before, there is no learning without memory. The more you can enhance your memory the better you will be able to learn. In every course there is some theory that has to be remembered. The quicker you can get the theory down the more time you can spend on practicing the information. Many first- and second-year university subjects are memory-based. If you have a strong memory system in place, you will succeed in anything that you choose to study. There are a few things you should consider to enhance your performance in your area of study. First, never learn just to pass an exam. What is the purpose of doing well in an exam and not knowing what you have learned two weeks later? Learning is not a destination; it is a continuous process. All the “A” students that I have ever interviewed prepare and plan their learning. They do little bits over time. They don’t stress before an exam, because the hard work is already done. All the “F” students overdose on energy drinks the night before and stress their way through the information hoping it will stick for the exam. So break your learning down and master the material over time. Before

Any large firm will operate in a large number of segments, that is, in a large number of customer/product combinations where a different formula is required to maximize revenue relative to effort and/or where different competitors are met. In some of these segments, the individual large firm will generate large surpluses and in other segments much lower surpluses (or even deficits). It will tend to be true, therefore, that 80 percent of surpluses or profits are generated by 20 percent of segments and by 20 percent of customers and by 20 percent of products. The most profitable segments will tend to (but will not always) be where the firm enjoys the highest market shares and where the firm has the most loyal customers (loyalty being defined by being longstanding and least likely to defect to competitors). • Within any firm, as with all entities dependent on nature and human endeavor, there is likely to be an inequality between inputs and outputs, an imbalance between effort and reward. Externally, this is reflected in the fact that some markets, products, and customers are much more profitable than others. Internally, the same principle is reflected by the fact that some resources, be they people, factories, machines, or permutations
